###   :heavy_check_mark: Features of Speaking Class

## :question: How user-friendly is the tool for both teachers and students?

 
+ ####  Easy to make learning materials (for teachers)
  In order to use the speaking class, learning materials that students will practice repeatedly before class must be produced on the teacher's webpage, which can be easily made into an Excel file.

 ### :question: How does the tool integrate with traditional English teaching methods? 
 Learning materials are reflecting the English curriculum and textbook contents for students.

+ #### Individual practice (for students)
  Because this app is a method that a single student practices personally rather than presenting in front of a large number of students, introverted students can also practice speaking focusing on their pronunciation.

+ #### Confident speech (for students)
  Students can increase their confidence in speaking English by checking the native speaker's voice provided by the program and practicing their speech sufficiently.

+ #### Customized education (for both teachers and students)
  Learning by class and step is possible, so learning by level is possible.
  <br>Customized education is possible. Individual students' progress and level can be known, allowing more detailed feedback than previous classes.

## :question: What kind of interactive features that the tool offer to engage students?
### :collision: Speaking Battle
Speaking Battle is a game-type learning tab that quickly clears English sentences that fit the meaning of the Korean language. Teachers can present their own English questions for students to use in the game. Once the game starts, students simply say the English sentences that fit the meaning of the Korean language after clicking on the microphone. The rankings are determined according to the time required. Through these games, students can practice speaking in an interesting way and review what they learned in their class.
