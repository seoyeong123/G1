+ #### Individual practice
  Because this app is a method that a single student practices personally rather than presenting in front of a large number of students, introverted students can also practice speaking focusing on their pronunciation.

+ #### Confident speech
  Students can increase their confidence in speaking English by checking the native speaker's voice provided by the program and practicing their speech sufficiently.

+ #### Customized education
  Learning by class and step is possible, so learning by level is possible.
  <br>Customized education is possible. Individual students' progress and level can be known, allowing more detailed feedback than previous classes.
