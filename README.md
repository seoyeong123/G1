#   :heavy_check_mark: Features of Speaking Class

## :question: How user-friendly is the tool for both teachers and students?

 
+ ####  Easy to make learning materials (for teachers)
  In order to use the speaking class, learning materials that students will practice repeatedly before class must be produced on the teacher's webpage, which can be easily made into an Excel file.
  ![ÏóëÏÖÄ Îì±Î°ù](https://github.com/n1655h/S24/assets/162934997/d4e03944-af13-4e6d-af25-e6ad6836a4e4)
![KakaoTalk_20240415_144308056](https://github.com/n1655h/S24/assets/162934997/3c42cfec-d6b0-4e98-9cf0-54e0b0ea0d04)

 ### :question: How does the tool integrate with traditional English teaching methods? 
 Learning materials are reflecting the English curriculum and textbook contents for students.
 ![KakaoTalk_20240415_164032913](https://github.com/n1655h/S24/assets/162934997/8721c680-51a1-42a3-a319-87e7389da1f5)
 
+ #### Individual practice (for students)
  Because this app is a method that a single student practices personally rather than presenting in front of a large number of students, introverted students can also practice speaking focusing on their pronunciation.

+ #### Confident speech (for students)
  Students can increase their confidence in speaking English by checking the native speaker's voice provided by the program and practicing their speech sufficiently.

+ #### Customized education (for both teachers and students)
  Learning by class and step is possible, so learning by level is possible.
  <br>Customized education is possible. Individual students' progress and level can be known, allowing more detailed feedback than previous classes.

## :question: What kind of interactive features that the tool offer to engage students?
### :collision: Speaking Battle
Speaking Battle is a game-type learning tab that quickly clears English sentences that fit the meaning of the Korean language. Teachers can present their own English questions for students to use in the game. Once the game starts, students simply say the English sentences that fit the meaning of the Korean language after clicking on the microphone. The rankings are determined according to the time required. Through these games, students can practice speaking in an interesting way and review what they learned in their class.

## Script for the video :memo:
Hello everyone.
We found good educational applications that we would like to introduce to you.
It is app that called "AI speaking class" and "Mentimeter"
Speaking class is an application that helps teachers guide students through conversation textbooks. Anyone can create conversation learning materials with just one conversation textbook. Teachers create and provide conversation situations to students, and students can improve their conversation skills by answering the conversation situations created by teachers.
At this point, the algorithm is applied to some functions such as hints and asking questions, so the actual conversation situation can be created more simply and quickly by using ai. In addition, students' progress, evaluation, and analysis results can be seen at a glance, so students' learning results can be identified and feedback can be provided. In addition, since this app is a method that a single student practices personally rather than presenting in front of a large number of students, introverted students can also practice speaking focusing on their pronunciation. Students can increase their confidence in speaking English by checking the native speaker's voice provided by the program and practicing their speech sufficiently. In addition, learning by class and step is possible, so learning by level is possible. In addition, it is different from other teaching equipment in that it can create conversation tests or problems more efficiently from the perspective of not only students but also teachers.
The effects of using this app in traditional classes are as follows.
1. Students who are familiar with electronic devices can be interested in participating in class. Existing classes that only use textbooks can be boring to students. As the age range for using electronic devices decreases a lot these days, students' interest and participation can be increased by using mobile phones or laptops. In particular, with the introduction of ai such as chat gpt, many changes have occurred in education, and I think that adolescents can feel more convenient because they are exposed to the use of ai, which is the current issue.
2. Customized education is possible. Individual students' progress and level can be known, allowing more detailed feedback than previous classes. In existing classes in elementary school classrooms, speaking learning is often poor because individual students and teachers' one-on-one customized conversation situations are not well created. However, the speaking class can complement the limitations of traditional classroom instruction because the teacher can directly organize the progress and unit desired by the teacher and intuitively judge the individual student's participation and achievement.
3. It is also possible to have conversations between students. Although it is an app that you practice individually, if you use it in class, you can also increase interactions between students. In the case of applying this app to class, after individual students had time to practice a specific phrase through this app, they discussed with other students to make sentences through the phrase. In this way, you can exchange opinions with other students and expect to improve the learning effect.
Then Using a mentimeter has the advantage of being able to induce students' interest and intuitively share students' thoughts because the content entered on one screen is immediately shown to all students. If it is used in class, it has a motivational effect and can be used whenever you want to collect students' opinions, such as in the middle of class or final activities. And as a final activity, you can also use it to summarize the content by entering the most important or memorable keywords you learned in class.
Thank you.
