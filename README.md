## 3. Digital Tool 

 Speaking Class & Mentimeter

 ## Speaking class :speech_balloon:
  + Speaking class is an application that helps teachers guide students through conversation textbooks. Anyone can create conversation learning materials with just one conversation textbook. Teachers create and provide conversation situations to students, and students can improve their conversation skills by answering the conversation situations created by teachers.

  + At this point, the algorithm is applied to some functions such as hints and asking questions, so the actual conversation situation can be created more simply and quickly by using ai. In addition, students' progress, evaluation, and analysis results can be seen at a glance, so students' learning results can be identified and feedback can be provided. In addition, since this app is a method that a single student practices personally rather than presenting in front of a large number of students, introverted students can also practice speaking focusing on their pronunciation. Students can increase their confidence in speaking English by checking the native speaker's voice provided by the program and practicing their speech sufficiently. In addition, learning by class and step is possible, so learning by level is possible. In addition, it is different from other teaching equipment in that it can create conversation tests or problems more efficiently from the perspective of not only students but also teachers.

### The effects of using this app
1. Students who are familiar with electronic devices can be interested in participating in class. Existing classes that only use textbooks can be boring to students. 
2. Customized education is possible. Individual students' progress and level can be known, allowing more detailed feedback than previous classes. In existing classes in elementary school classrooms, speaking learning is often poor because individual students and teachers' one-on-one customized conversation situations are not well created. 
3. It is also possible to have conversations between students. 

 
 ## Mentimeter :thought_balloon:
 + Mentimeter is a web application that allows you to share various opinions and thoughts of participants in real time online.
 ### üìçHow to use a mentimeter?
1. The teacher accesses the link at the top when you Google Mentimeter.
2. Create an account using Facebook or Gmail and log in.
3. Create a new presentation page on the dashboard that is suitable for use in classes.
4. Click the [share] button at the top right and distribute a survey access link or QR code to students.
5. Students access the teacher-distributed mentimeter page and post questions in groups in real time.
6. Students post their answers in real time.
7. After selecting the keyword that seems to be the biggest word in the entire class as the class opinion, complete the English sentence expressing the opinion and finish the class by speaking together with the entire student.
